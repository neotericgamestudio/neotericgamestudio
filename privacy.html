<br><p class="lineheight">In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</li>

<br><p class="lineheight">We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">

</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li id="whoshare">- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
</ul>
<br><p class="lineheight">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight" id="inforetain">We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

</ul>
<br><p class="lineheight">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight" id="infosafe">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p><p id ="privacyrights">Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" target="_blank">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">Account Information</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
<ul type="square">

</ul>
<ul type="square">
 <li>- Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
</ul>
<br><p class="lineheight" id="DNT">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.

<br><p class="lineheight">If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at support@neotericgamestudio.com.</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<br><p class="lineheight">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. <p id="caresidents">As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
